Sometimes, in many libraries, you may come across import statements combined with an underscore (\_) like this:

![](./images/006/006_01.jpg)

What does that do?

This executes the initialization code (init() function) of that package without creating a name reference for it.

For example, in the "underscore" package, I have an init:

![](./images/006/006_02.jpg)

And in main(), using underscore import, even if I don't do anything, it still prints:

![](./images/006/006_03.jpg)
