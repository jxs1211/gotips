Why performance? See the reply.

In the past, I used `make(a, 10)` to pre-allocate, but.

I frequently made the mistake of habitually using `append()`, which resulted in many leading zeroes (refer to the image below)

To avoid this, I use a more effective method of pre-allocation: `make(a, 0, 10)`.
