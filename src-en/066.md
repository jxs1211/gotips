# Tip #66 在 fmt.Errorf 中简化你的错误信息

In Go, when we're working with errors, it's important to give enough detail so we know what went wrong.

There's a previous tip, Golang Tip #38, that talks about this. We can check it out here for more context: https://twitter.com/func25/status/1764265328165753176

(Thanks to

, we've got an additional suggestion to improve our error handling.)

Now, we should be familiar with using fmt.Errorf and the %w to wrap errors:

Typically, we might end up with a long error message like this:

"error while crawling: can't retrieve log: failed to open file server-logs.txt: file not exist."

This message is clear but longer than it needs to be. It repeats phrases like "error while", "failed to," which we already know because we're dealing with an error.

So here's a better way to do it:

Notice the difference?

Instead of the long message, you end up with something shorter and more direct:

"crawling: retrieve log: open file server-logs.txt: file not exist."

The message still tells you what was happening when the error came up, and it's much easier to read.

So, when we're writing error messages in Go, keep them short and focused on the action that didn't work.
