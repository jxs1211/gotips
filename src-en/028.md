It's common to encounter complex conditional logic handled through multiple if-else statements:

This approach isn't wrong.

But there's a cleaner, more readable alternative: collapsing if-else chains into switch statements

Now, first, we should understand how the switch-case structure works:

We can ignore 'initialization', and also 'expression'. When we do this, we are essentially writing: switch true {}, but the true is implicit.
