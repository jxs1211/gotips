The regular time.Sleep() doesn't care about context. If you set it to pause for 5 minutes, it will pause the process for the full duration, no matter what.

Even if we try to use it with a context, like in the example below, it won't stop until 10 seconds later:

We discussed the solution in Tip #63: Avoid time.Sleep() https://twitter.com/func25/status/1766815880745533712

The solution we talked about before works, but it's a bit much to write over and over.

So, let's make a more user-friendly version that still lets us use a Sleep() function but respects when the context is cancelled.

We can create a "fake" sleep function that stops if the context tells it to:

This way, we can pause our code in Go, but if something tells the context to stop, the sleep will end early:

Well, we usually don't need to.

Most of the time, when the context is cancelled, it's not about the sleep function. It's usually because of a larger issue in the program, which includes the sleep part.

For example, if there are steps after the sleep() in your code, and they're set up to listen to the context, they'll stop too if the context is cancelled.

So, let's make our sleep shorter and more to the point:
