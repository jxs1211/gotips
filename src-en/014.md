This might seem a bit unusual at first, but there's a practical reason behind it.

Why lowercase?

Error messages often get wrapped or combined with other messages.

If an error string starts with a capital letter, it can look odd or out of place when it's in the middle of a sentence.

Starting with a lowercase letter helps it blend more naturally.

// application startup failed: failed to initialize module: could not open the database

Another point is the appearance of "..." at the end of the message.

This means, any text following %w in a formatted error string is intended to be appended at the end of the whole message.

Why no punctual?

It's to ensure that when one message is appended to another, the result looks like a coherent sentence rather than a jumble of phrases.
