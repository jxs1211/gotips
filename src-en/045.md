# Tip #Always Manage Your Goroutine Lifetime

Goroutines are stackful (!), meaning they take more memory than similar constructs in other languages, at least 2KB each. This adds up quickly, 10K goroutines take up 20MB.

(!: I will put the information at the bottom of this tip)

I must admit that I have run a bunch of jobs with for-loops and time.Sleep:

It's quite convenient to write it this (lazy) way, but it has drawbacks.

If you read tip #43 about graceful shutdowns, you'll understand that, there's no way this function can shut down gracefully (unless by chance during time.Sleep), right?

Sleep -> SIGTERM -> Running -> Interrupted.

So, for tasks that don't inherently have a clear end (such as serving network connections, watching a configuration file, etc.), use cancellation signals or conditions that clearly define when these tasks should end.

And this context should be propagated from the base context, which is canceled when a SIGTERM is received.

So, at least, we know when it stops, even if it's at program termination.

Here is another scenario where a goroutine could be stuck forever:

We may think it is easy to determine when the routine finishes once the jobs channel is closed.

But when is the jobs channel closed?

Perhaps not, there is a mistake where we don't close the channel but return from the function, and the goroutine hangs indefinitely, leading to a memory leak.

So, always make it obvious when goroutines start and stop, and pass context to the long-running process.
