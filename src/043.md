# Tip #Gracefully Shut Down Your Application

When we talk about gracefully shutting down an application, there are a few key guarantees we aim to achieve:

- No new requests: The server stops accepting new requests.
- Completion of ongoing tasks: Waits for currently processing tasks to reach a logical stopping point.
- Resource cleanup: We release resources such as database connections, open files, network connections, etc.

There are some different implementations out there, but I try to give the shortest way for simplicity:

First, we create a (main) context that is cancelled when an interrupt signal (Ctrl+C) or a SIGTERM is received.

Then we make 2 goroutines, both coordinated by errgroup (if you don't know what it is, consider reading from https://blog.devtrovert.com/p/go-errgroup-you-havent-used-goroutines):

- The first one is straightforward, launching the server but remember, ListenAndServe always returns a non-nil error.
- The second is interesting, it's the place we can put our graceful cleanup. This goroutine waits for gCtx.Done() to close, which is propagated from our main ctx.

If our service is running on Kubernetes, consider not terminating new requests immediately after SIGTERM.

Your application must not terminate instantly, but rather complete all active requests and continue to listen for incoming connections that arrive after the Pod shutdown begins.

It may take a bit for Kubernetes to update all kube-proxies and load balancers.

This is the simplified version, you may consider adding a timeout to the server's configuration, checking if the error is closed, adding a timeout to the shutdown,...
