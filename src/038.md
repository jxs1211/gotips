In Go, errors are treated as values. We return errors instead of throwing them:

Simply returning errors without any extra details can make it hard to figure out where they came from and why they happened.

This can make fixing bugs and handling errors tougher.

Using fmt.Errorf with %w

Go 1.13 brought us a way to add more information to errors while keeping the original error. This is done by using fmt.Errorf with the %w verb.

It wraps an error so you can look into it more if you need to later:

Let's look at an example to see why adding details is important:

Which one below tells you more?

- "Failed to retrieve resource: Authorization check failed: User 123 does not exist: mongo: no documents in result"
- "Failed to retrieve resource: mongo: no documents in result"

The first one clearly shows that the problem starts with a user that doesn't exist, leading to the failure. The second message doesn't help us understand if the problem is with the user or the resource.

Without these details, we might miss important clues about what went wrong.

Plus, we can use errors .Is() to pinpoint the exact type of error:
